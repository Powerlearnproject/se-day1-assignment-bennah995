#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-it is the process of designing, creating,testing,and maintaining sotware programs . the goal of software enineering is to build software that is reliable. the importance is 1. it drives innovation by developing new technologies and shapes 2.it enhances operational efficiency and productivity across industries. 3.it tackles complex problems providing solutions that adress specific needs

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

-in 1950-1960 the creation of early programming languages like fortran and cobol.it made easier to write sotfwares. -1970 the development of structured programming arised like loops which helped organize codes better and it improved code readability and maintainance. -1980- programming languages like c++ and later java script were introduced and this languages allowed programers to create softwares.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

planning- identfying project goals, defining requirements and create a project plan
analysis- this is gathering details through interviews, oservation and surveys.
design-creating architectural designs this is used to provide a blueprint for developers to follow.
development-this is the actual creation of the software application.
testing -this ensures quality and reliable before deployment .
deployment-makes the software available for use.
maintainance- keeps the software functioning .
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

-agile is more flexible and adaptive to change compared to waterfall -waterfall has limited client involvement after innitial stages while agile involves continuous client interaction -waterfall emphasizes extensive documentation while agile focuses on minimal necssary documentation. -example senario of agile is developing a mobile app where requirement are expected to evolve based on user feedback and market trends -example scenario of waterfall is developing software for a banking system with well-defined requirement and a need for documentation.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

  Software engineering role and responsibilities
designing and omplementing software

writing and documenting code for systems

identifying and fixing issues in the software

collaborating with other other developers.

updating and improving software systems.

Quality assurance engineer
Designing and executing tests to identify software defects.

developing automation testing scripts.

report and tracting issues

ensurig the software meets quality standards and requirement before release.

Project manager

project planning

allocating resources effectively.

identifying risk and managing

acts like an intermediate.

monitoring and reporting.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. (IDEs) importance

it boost productivity
error reduction
it enhances collabortion example is visual studio IDE provides and supports other programming lannguages and includes features like intergrated debugging. (VCS)
it tracks changes allowing developers to track of every modification made to the codebase.
multiple develpers can work on the same project simulteneously without overwriting each others changes.
it provides a safety net for backup and recovery
it allows developers to work on new features independently by branching and mwerging. example mercurial another distributed VCS can offer similar capabilities to GIT, known for its performance.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

keeping up with rapid technology changes strategies-continuous learning and joining forums 2.fixing issues and Debugging strategy - using s systematic to debug by isolating the problem. 3.managing complex projects strategies- using project mangement tools like JIRA to organize track progress. 4.balancing quality and speed strategy- using automated testing to ensure new changes dont break existing functionality.
handling old written code strategy- documenting your changes and ensuring the code is understandable for future maintainance.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1.unit testing- it tests individual units its importance is it helps the issues early in the development process or debugging 2.intergration testing - it tests the intergration between components.its importance is it ensures different part of the system work together correctly. 3.system testing- it tsts the entire system as a whole so that it can meet desired requirement. its importance is it validate and complete software ensuring it functions correctly. 4.Acceptance testing -conducted to determine if the software meets the business requirement. its importance is provides confidence that the software meets users needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

it involves designing and refining prompts -the input queries or instructions given to AI to ensure accurate and useful prompts. its importance is

crafting prompts that are clear and specific that helps the AI understand exactly what you are asking for.
it ensures AI responses are aligned with specific scenario or topic.
it saves time and improves the users experience by delivering accurate resulte quickly. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
improved prompt provide a brief overview of the major events in world history . why imoroved prompt is more effective. 1.it specifies the time period and wht exactly to cover 2.it narrows down the broad topics 3.it asks for a brief overview .
